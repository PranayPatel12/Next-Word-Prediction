Methodology
The development of the next-word prediction model encompasses several critical stages:

Data Collection: Gathering a substantial and diverse text corpus to train the model effectively.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the text data, which includes tokenization, removal of stop words, and handling punctuation to ensure the data is suitable for model training.
Word Embedding: Implementing word embedding techniques to transform textual data into continuous vector representations, capturing semantic relationships between words.
Model Architecture: Constructing an RNN-based model capable of learning sequential patterns in the data to predict subsequent words in a sequence.
Training: Feeding the preprocessed data into the model and adjusting parameters through backpropagation to minimize prediction errors.
Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using appropriate metrics and refining it to enhance accuracy and generalization capabilities.
Implementation Details
The model is implemented using Python, leveraging libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras for neural network construction and training. The RNN architecture is designed to capture temporal dependencies in text data, and word embeddings are employed to represent words in a dense vector space, facilitating the learning of semantic relationships.
